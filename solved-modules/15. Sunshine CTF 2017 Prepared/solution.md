As for the previous two challenges that were done, this challenge is similar as well but Pie is fully enabled. <br>
The main difference from this challenge is that it generates values with the rand function but in a loop 50 times. <br>
Since it uses the same time as a seed, all we need to do is make a c program that will guess the random number 50 times in a row. <br>
To do this all we need to do is use the same seed and use a loop a to generate each random number 50 times. <br>
We need to have the flag.txt file in the directory and when we run it with the prepared file, we see 50 inputs and the flag at the end. <br>
I also added an alternate program that runs on its own and now with the prepared binary file. <br>
<br>
Flag = isun{pr3d1ct_3very_p[]5s1bl3_scen@r10} <br>
