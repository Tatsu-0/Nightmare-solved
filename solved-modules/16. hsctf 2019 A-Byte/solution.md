After gathering all the basic information about the binary file we can go into ghidra. <br>
When looking into FUN_0010073a function, we see all the code that we need to work with. <br>
We see that it only wants one argument and checks if its 0x23 bytes long. <br>
Then it will then set all the bytes equal to the byte xored by 1. <br>
It finally checks to see if our input is equal to local_38 and if it is then we solve the challenge. <br>
Although it says that local_38 is equal to "i", it is actually equal to 0x69 if looked through the assembly code. <br>
So, we are working with a char array that moves in the input one byte at a time. <br>
It moves in 35 bytes which is the same amount for the length of data we pass in as an argument. <br>
We know, what input we control, the algorithm that is passed through, and the end result that it has to be. <br>
That is all we need to make a z3 script that will find the solution for us. <br>
