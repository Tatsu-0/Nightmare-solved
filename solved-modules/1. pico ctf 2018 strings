This was an easy one to start off on which you only needed one command.
But its good to get in the habit to check the file:
'file strings' command will give information about the file.
You can run the file and see what it says or asks for.
If you cant run the file you can give it execution permissions by 'chmod +x strings'
The only command you need to give it is 'strings strings | grep {' which will find the flag in the file.
