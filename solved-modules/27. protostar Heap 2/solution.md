So what were are suppsoed to do to solve this challenge is to have it say "you have logged in already!". <br>
But to do this all we need to do is set auth and service to whatever we want and then put login. <br>
Then it says that "you have logged in already!" <br>
But if it doesnt work for you then your supposed to put auth to whatever you want except 0 and service to 0. <br>
